    <description><![CDATA[As I&rsquo;m working on my latest contribution around FoundationDB and Rust, I had the chance to dig a bit into how FoundationDB&rsquo;s bindings are offering helpers to generate keys. Their approach is interesting enough to deserve a blogpost ðŸ˜Ž
Row key? When you are using a key/value store, the design of the row key is extremely important, as this will define how well:
 your scans will be optimized, your puts will be spread, you will avoid hot-spotting a shard/region.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[TL;DR: I&rsquo;m really happy to announce my latest open-source project called Record-Store ðŸš€ Please check it out on https://pierrez.github.io/record-store.
What? Record-Store is a layer running on top of FoundationDB. It provides abstractions to create, load and deletes customer-defined data called records, which are hold into a RecordSpace. We would like to have this kind of flow for developers:
 Opening RecordSpace, for example prod/users Create a protobuf definition which will be used as schema Upsert schema Push records Query records delete records  You need another KeySpace to store another type of data, or maybe a KeySpace dedicated to production env?]]></description>
