My passion for programming was kind of late, I typed my first line of code at my engineering school. It then became a passion, something I’m willing to do at work, on my free-time, at night or the week-end.</description>

 We, at Metrics Data Platform, are working everyday with Warp10 Platform, an open source Time Series database. You may not know it because it’s not as famous as Prometheus or InfluxDB but Warp10 is the most powerful and generic solution to store and analyze sensor data. It’s the core of Metrics, and many internal teams from OVH are using Metrics Data Platform to monitor their infrastructure.</description>
