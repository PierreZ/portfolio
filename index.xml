      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;m working on my latest contribution around FoundationDB and Rust, I had the chance to dig a bit into how FoundationDB&amp;rsquo;s bindings are offering helpers to generate keys. Their approach is interesting enough to deserve a blogpost üòé
Row key? When you are using a key/value store, the design of the row key is extremely important, as this will define how well:
 your scans will be optimized, your puts will be spread, you will avoid hot-spotting a shard/region.</description>

      <description>Episode You can listen to the episode here.
Sum-up etcd est une base de donn√©es bien connue de toutes les √©quipes op√©rationnelles, puisqu&amp;rsquo;elle est au coeur de Kubernetes. Cependant, mis √† part sa documentation en ligne, c&amp;rsquo;est une base de donn√©es sur laquelle il n&amp;rsquo;existe aucune litt√©rature. Et c&amp;rsquo;est une chose que j&amp;rsquo;ai peine √† comprendre pour un projet de cette importance qui a un tel impact sur notre quotidien.</description>

      <description>Notes About is a blogpost serie you will find a lot of links, videos, quotes, podcasts to click on about a specific topic. Today we will discover ETCD.
Overview of ETCD As stated in the official documentation:
 etcd is a strongly consistent, distributed key-value store that provides a reliable way to store data that needs to be accessed by a distributed system or cluster of machines. It gracefully handles leader elections during network partitions and can tolerate machine failure, even in the leader node.</description>

      <title>Record-Layer 101</title>

      <guid>https://pierrezemb.fr/talks/record-layer-101/</guid>
      <description>Abstract The FoundationDB Record Layer is an open source library that provides a record-oriented datastore with semantic similar to a relational database, implemented on top of FoundationDB. It is highly used within Apple by CloudKit, Apple‚Äôs cloud backend service to host billions of independent databases, many with a common schema.
In this talk, we will dig into the paper and the library&amp;rsquo;s concepts and feature. You will also discover how to use the library from a developer&amp;rsquo;s point-of-view, with examples taken from ETCD-Layer and Record-Store.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve just realized that I‚Äôve spent the last decade programming ü§Ø While 2020 feels like a strange year, I thought it would be nice to write down a retrospective of the last 10 years üóì
Learning to program üë®üèª‚Äçüíª I wrote my first Hello, world program somewhere around September 2010, when I started my engineering school to do some electronics, but that C language got me. I spent 6 months struggling to understand pointers and memory.</description>

      <title>Announcing Record-Store, a new (experimental) place for your data</title>
      <link>https://pierrezemb.fr/posts/announcing-record-store/</link>

      <guid>https://pierrezemb.fr/posts/announcing-record-store/</guid>
      <description>TL;DR: I&amp;rsquo;m really happy to announce my latest open-source project called Record-Store üöÄ Please check it out on https://pierrez.github.io/record-store.
What? Record-Store is a layer running on top of FoundationDB. It provides abstractions to create, load and deletes customer-defined data called records, which are hold into a RecordSpace. We would like to have this kind of flow for developers:
 Opening RecordSpace, for example prod/users Create a protobuf definition which will be used as schema Upsert schema Push records Query records delete records  You need another KeySpace to store another type of data, or maybe a KeySpace dedicated to production env?</description>

      <description>Diving Into is a blogpost serie where we are digging a specific part of the project&amp;rsquo;s basecode. In this episode, we will digg into the implementation behind ETCD&amp;rsquo;s Linearizable reads.
 What is ETCD? From the official website:
 etcd is a strongly consistent, distributed key-value store that provides a reliable way to store data that needs to be accessed by a distributed system or cluster of machines. It gracefully handles leader elections during network partitions and can tolerate machine failure, even in the leader node.</description>

      <description>Notes About is a blogpost serie you will find a lot of links, videos, quotes, podcasts to click on about a specific topic. Today we will discover Raft&amp;rsquo;s paper called &amp;lsquo;In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm&amp;rsquo;.
 As I&amp;rsquo;m digging into ETCD, I needed to refresh my memory about Raft. I started by reading the paper located here and I&amp;rsquo;m also playing with the amazing Raft labs made by PingCAP.</description>

      <description>Abstract OVHcloud is the biggest European cloud provider. From dedicated servers to Managed Kubernetes, from VMware¬Æ based Hosted Private Cloud to OpenStack-based Public Cloud, we have over 1.4 million customers worldwide.
Internally, we have been running Apache Kafka for years, and despite all the skills obtained operating multiples clusters with millions of messages per second, we decided to shift and build the foundation of our &amp;lsquo;topic-as-a-service&amp;rsquo; product called ioStream on Apache Pulsar.</description>
