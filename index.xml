      <description>Diving Into is a blogpost serie where we are digging a specific part of the project&amp;rsquo;s basecode. In this episode, we will digg into the implementation behind ETCD&amp;rsquo;s Linearizable reads.
 What is ETCD? From the official website:
 etcd is a strongly consistent, distributed key-value store that provides a reliable way to store data that needs to be accessed by a distributed system or cluster of machines. It gracefully handles leader elections during network partitions and can tolerate machine failure, even in the leader node.</description>

      <description>Notes About is a blogpost serie you will find a lot of links, videos, quotes, podcasts to click on about a specific topic. Today we will discover Raft&amp;rsquo;s paper called &amp;lsquo;In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm&amp;rsquo;.
 As I&amp;rsquo;m digging into ETCD, I needed to refresh my memory about Raft. I started by reading the paper located here and I&amp;rsquo;m also playing with the amazing Raft labs made by PingCAP.</description>

      <title>Building a Messaging Solutions for OVHcloud with Apache Pulsar</title>

      <description>Abstract OVHcloud is the biggest European cloud provider. From dedicated servers to Managed Kubernetes, from VMwareÂ® based Hosted Private Cloud to OpenStack-based Public Cloud, we have over 1.4 million customers worldwide.
Internally, we have been running Apache Kafka for years, and despite all the skills obtained operating multiples clusters with millions of messages per second, we decided to shift and build the foundation of our &amp;lsquo;topic-as-a-service&amp;rsquo; product called ioStream on Apache Pulsar.</description>

      <description>Abstract Kafka-on-Pulsar has been one of the most anticipated features in the Pulsar ecosystem. The Kafka-on-Pulsar project was initiated by StreamNative and the OVHCloud team quickly joined the project to collaborate on its development. Kafka-on-Pulsar enables Kafka applications to leverage Pulsarâ€™s powerful features, such as streamlined operations with enterprise-grade multi-tenancy, without modifying code.
In this webinar, Sijie Guo, from StreamNative, and Pierre Zemb, from OVHCloud, will introduce KoP and discuss the following:</description>

 This post has been published on both the StreamNative and OVHcloud blogs and was co-authored by Sijie Guo, Jia Zhai and Pierre Zemb. Thanks Horacio Gonzalez for the illustrations!
We are excited to announce that StreamNative and OVHcloud are open-sourcing &amp;ldquo;Kafka on Pulsar&amp;rdquo; (KoP). KoP brings the native Apache Kafka protocol support to Apache Pulsar by introducing a Kafka protocol handler on Pulsar brokers.</description>

      <description>Diving Into is a blogpost serie where we are digging a specific part of of the project&amp;rsquo;s basecode. In this episode, we will digg into Kafka&amp;rsquo;s protocol.
 The protocol reference For the last few months, I worked a lot around Kafka&amp;rsquo;s protocols, first by creating a fully async Kafka to Pulsar Proxy in Rust, and now by contributing directly to KoP (Kafka On Pulsar). The full Kafka Protocol documentation is available here, but it does not offer a global view of what is happening for a classic Producer and Consumer exchange.</description>
