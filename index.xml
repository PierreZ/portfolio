    <description><![CDATA[Learning distributed systems is tough. You need to go through a lot of academic papers, concepts, code review, before being able to have a global pictures. Thankfully, there is a lot of resources out there that can help you to get started. Here&rsquo;s a list of resources I used to learn distributed systems. I will keep this blogpost up-to-date with books, conferences, and so on.
 A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn&rsquo;t even know existed can render your own computer unusable.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[As I&rsquo;m working on my latest contribution around FoundationDB and Rust, I had the chance to dig a bit into how FoundationDB&rsquo;s bindings are offering helpers to generate keys. Their approach is interesting enough to deserve a blogpost 😎
Row key? When you are using a key/value store, the design of the row key is extremely important, as this will define how well:
 your scans will be optimized, your puts will be spread, you will avoid hot-spotting a shard/region.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Notes About is a blogpost serie you will find a lot of links, videos, quotes, podcasts to click on about a specific topic. Today we will discover ETCD.
Overview of ETCD As stated in the official documentation:
 etcd is a strongly consistent, distributed key-value store that provides a reliable way to store data that needs to be accessed by a distributed system or cluster of machines. It gracefully handles leader elections during network partitions and can tolerate machine failure, even in the leader node.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I’ve just realized that I’ve spent the last decade programming 🤯 While 2020 feels like a strange year, I thought it would be nice to write down a retrospective of the last 10 years 🗓
Learning to program 👨🏻‍💻 I wrote my first Hello, world program somewhere around September 2010, when I started my engineering school to do some electronics, but that C language got me. I spent 6 months struggling to understand pointers and memory.]]></description>

    <title>Announcing Record-Store, a new (experimental) place for your data</title>

    <description><![CDATA[TL;DR: I&rsquo;m really happy to announce my latest open-source project called Record-Store 🚀 Please check it out on https://pierrez.github.io/record-store.
What? Record-Store is a layer running on top of FoundationDB. It provides abstractions to create, load and deletes customer-defined data called records, which are hold into a RecordSpace. We would like to have this kind of flow for developers:
 Opening RecordSpace, for example prod/users Create a protobuf definition which will be used as schema Upsert schema Push records Query records delete records  You need another KeySpace to store another type of data, or maybe a KeySpace dedicated to production env?]]></description>
