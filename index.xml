      <title>Introducing Kafka-on-Pulsar: Bring native Kafka protocol support to Apache Pulsar</title>

      <description>Abstract Kafka-on-Pulsar has been one of the most anticipated features in the Pulsar ecosystem. The Kafka-on-Pulsar project was initiated by StreamNative and the OVHCloud team quickly joined the project to collaborate on its development. Kafka-on-Pulsar enables Kafka applications to leverage Pulsarâ€™s powerful features, such as streamlined operations with enterprise-grade multi-tenancy, without modifying code.
In this webinar, Sijie Guo, from StreamNative, and Pierre Zemb, from OVHCloud, will introduce KoP and discuss the following:</description>

      <description>This is a repost from OVHcloud&amp;rsquo;s official blogpost., please read it there to support my company. Thanks Horacio Gonzalez for the awesome drawings!
 This post has been published on both the StreamNative and OVHcloud blogs and was co-authored by Sijie Guo, Jia Zhai and Pierre Zemb. Thanks Horacio Gonzalez for the illustrations!
We are excited to announce that StreamNative and OVHcloud are open-sourcing &amp;ldquo;Kafka on Pulsar&amp;rdquo; (KoP). KoP brings the native Apache Kafka protocol support to Apache Pulsar by introducing a Kafka protocol handler on Pulsar brokers.</description>

 In today&amp;rsquo;s blogpost, we&amp;rsquo;re going to take a look at our upstream contribution to Apache HBase&amp;rsquo;s stochastic load balancer, based on our experience of running HBase clusters to support OVHcloud&amp;rsquo;s monitoring.
The context Have you ever wondered how:
 we generate the graphs for your OVHcloud server or web hosting package?</description>

      <description>Notes About is a blogpost serie you will find a lot of links, videos, quotes, podcasts to click on about a specific topic. Today we will discover FoundationDB.
 Overview of FoundationDB As stated in the official documentation:
 FoundationDB is a distributed database designed to handle large volumes of structured data across clusters of commodity servers. It organizes data as an ordered key-value store and employs ACID transactions for all operations.</description>

      <description>Diving Into is a blogpost serie where we are digging a specific part of of the project&amp;rsquo;s basecode. In this episode, we will digg into Kafka&amp;rsquo;s protocol.
 The protocol reference For the last few months, I worked a lot around Kafka&amp;rsquo;s protocols, first by creating a fully async Kafka to Pulsar Proxy in Rust, and now by contributing directly to KoP (Kafka On Pulsar). The full Kafka Protocol documentation is available here, but it does not offer a global view of what is happening for a classic Producer and Consumer exchange.</description>

      <description>Diving Into is a blogpost serie where we are digging a specific part of of the project&amp;rsquo;s basecode. In this episode, we will digg into the implementation behind Hbase&amp;rsquo;s MemStore.
 tl;dr: Hbase is using the ConcurrentSkipListMap.
What is the MemStore?  The memtable from the official BigTable paper is the equivalent of the MemStore in Hbase.
 As rows are sorted lexicographically in Hbase, when data comes in, you need to have some kind of a in-memory buffer to order those keys.</description>

      <description>Abstract Apache Bookkeeper is the main datastore used by Apache Pulsar. This Top-Level Apache project is defined as Â« A scalable, fault-tolerant, and low-latency storage service optimized for real-time workloads Â». BookKeeper is suitable for a wide variety of use cases, from WAL to storage. In this talk, we will dive into Bookkeeperâ€™s concepts, the public API, deployments and how it is used within Pulsar.

      <description>In the last few months, there has been numerous blogposts about the end of the Hadoop-era. It is true that:
 Health of Hadoop-based companies are publicly bad Hadoop has a bad publicity with headlines like &amp;lsquo;What does the death of Hadoop mean for big data?&#39;  Hadoop, as a distributed-system, is hard to operate, but can be essential for some type of workload. As Hadoop is based on GFS, we can wonder how GFS evolved inside Google.</description>
