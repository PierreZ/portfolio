      <description>Abstract OVHcloud is the biggest European cloud provider. From dedicated servers to Managed Kubernetes, from VMware¬Æ based Hosted Private Cloud to OpenStack-based Public Cloud, we have over 1.4 million customers worldwide. Because of our Kubinception design(using Kubernetes to run Kubernetes), we are putting hundreds of customers in an ETCD cluster. This design is great to easily spawn control-planes for customers, but it is also putting a lot of pressure on ETCD.</description>

      <guid>https://pierrezemb.fr/talks/record-layer-101/</guid>
      <description>Abstract The FoundationDB Record Layer is an open source library that provides a record-oriented datastore with semantic similar to a relational database, implemented on top of FoundationDB. It is highly used within Apple by CloudKit, Apple‚Äôs cloud backend service to host billions of independent databases, many with a common schema.
In this talk, we will dig into the paper and the library&amp;rsquo;s concepts and feature. You will also discover how to use the library from a developer&amp;rsquo;s point-of-view, with examples taken from ETCD-Layer and Record-Store.</description>

      <description>Abstract OVHcloud is the biggest European cloud provider. From dedicated servers to Managed Kubernetes, from VMware¬Æ based Hosted Private Cloud to OpenStack-based Public Cloud, we have over 1.4 million customers worldwide.
Internally, we have been running Apache Kafka for years, and despite all the skills obtained operating multiples clusters with millions of messages per second, we decided to shift and build the foundation of our &amp;lsquo;topic-as-a-service&amp;rsquo; product called ioStream on Apache Pulsar.</description>

      <title>Introducing Kafka-on-Pulsar: Bring native Kafka protocol support to Apache Pulsar</title>
      <link>https://pierrezemb.fr/talks/announcing-kop/</link>

      <description>Abstract Kafka-on-Pulsar has been one of the most anticipated features in the Pulsar ecosystem. The Kafka-on-Pulsar project was initiated by StreamNative and the OVHCloud team quickly joined the project to collaborate on its development. Kafka-on-Pulsar enables Kafka applications to leverage Pulsar‚Äôs powerful features, such as streamlined operations with enterprise-grade multi-tenancy, without modifying code.
In this webinar, Sijie Guo, from StreamNative, and Pierre Zemb, from OVHCloud, will introduce KoP and discuss the following:</description>

      <description>Abstract What to do when you must monitor the whole infrastructure of the biggest European hosting and cloud provider? How to choose a tool when the most used ones fail to scale to your needs? How to build an Metrics platform to unify, conciliate and replace years of fragmented legacy partial solutions?

      <description>Abstract OVH has 27 data centers, more than 300 000 servers and 1.3 million customers. We operate one of the world‚Äôs largest cloud infrastructures on a daily basis, running millions of applications. Those softwares manage millions of transactions every second. To monitor such an architecture, OVH has chosen to build a unified monitoring platform: OVH Metrics Data Platform. Such a platform uses complex distributed systems to operate, based mainly on open source tools running on the JVM (Apache Kafka, Apache HBase, Warp 10, ‚Ä¶).</description>

      <title>Handling alerts at OVH-Scale with Apache Flink</title>
      <link>https://pierrezemb.fr/talks/ovh-alerts-flink/</link>

      <description>Abstract OVH relies heavily on metrics to effectively monitor its entire infrastructure. Offering a low-level vision and business, these allow teams to better operate the daily operation of our services. After managing more than 300 TB of telemetry, we started working on an alerting solution over this huge datalake. For that, we decided to use Apache Flink to manage all these large scale alerts. Today, this project manages the alerting of flagship OVH products such as Public Cloud Instances and Kubernetes.</description>
