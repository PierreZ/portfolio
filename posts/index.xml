      <description>HBase?  Apache HBase™ is a type of &amp;ldquo;NoSQL&amp;rdquo; database. &amp;ldquo;NoSQL&amp;rdquo; is a general term meaning that the database isn’t an RDBMS which supports SQL as its primary access language. Technically speaking, HBase is really more a &amp;ldquo;Data Store&amp;rdquo; than &amp;ldquo;Data Base&amp;rdquo; because it lacks many of the features you find in an RDBMS, such as typed columns, secondary indexes, triggers, and advanced query languages, etc.

My passion for programming was kind of late, I typed my first line of code at my engineering school. It then became a passion, something I’m willing to do at work, on my free-time, at night or the week-end.</description>

We, at Metrics Data Platform, are working everyday with Warp10 Platform, an open source Time Series database. You may not know it because it’s not as famous as Prometheus or InfluxDB but Warp10 is the most powerful and generic solution to store and analyze sensor data. It’s the core of Metrics, and many internal teams from OVH are using Metrics Data Platform to monitor their infrastructure.</description>

I’m still a student, so my point of view could be far from reality, be gentle ;)
tl;dr: Queue messaging are cool. Use them at the core of your architecture.I’m currently playing a lot around Kafka and Flink at work. I also discovered Vert.x at my local JUG.</description>

English is not my first language, so the whole story may have some mistakes… corrections and fixes will be greatly appreciated. I’m also still a student, so my point of view could be far from “production ready”, be gentle ;-)
In the last two years, there’s been a technology that became really hype.</description>
